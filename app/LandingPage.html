            <h3>About section</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to Planning Poker—a collaborative and dynamic approach to project estimation that transcends traditional methods. Rooted in agile principles, Planning Poker is a powerful technique designed to foster team communication, enhance consensus-building, and drive more accurate project timelines.</p>

            <p> At its core, Planning Poker transforms the often tedious process of project planning into an engaging and interactive experience. Developed to address the challenges of estimating effort in software development and other project-driven environments, this technique harnesses the collective intelligence of a diverse team.</p>

            <h3>How do you play Planning Poker</h3>
            
            <p> First of all make sure all team members are familiar with the Fibonacci sequence. Emphasize that the sequence is not chosen randomly—each number represents a different level of complexity or effort, with larger numbers indicating more significant challenges.

                1, 2, 3: Low effort or complexity.
                5, 8: Moderate effort or complexity.
                13, 21: Higher effort or complexity.
                And so on...
                Step 4: Initiate the </p>

            <p> Identify the tasks that require estimation. Break down the project into manageable units, such as user stories or features. Each of these units will be the focus of your estimation sessions.</p>

            <p> For each task, present it to the team. Discuss any relevant details and clarify any questions team members may have. Then, open the digital Planning Poker interface.</p>

            <p> Each team member privately selects a Fibonacci number that represents their estimation of the effort or complexity of the task. The use of Fibonacci numbers discourages precise estimations and encourages a relative scale.</p>

            <p> Next, all team members reveal their chosen Fibonacci numbers. If there's a wide range of votes, encourage a brief discussion to understand different perspectives and bring the team closer to a consensus.</p>

            <p> If there's still significant variance in estimates, repeat the process until the team converges on a more consistent estimation. Encourage open communication and consider factors that may impact the complexity of the task.</p>

            <p> Once the team reaches a consensus, record the final estimate. Then, repeat the process for each task until the project is fully estimated.</p>

            <p> Record the final estimate for each task and move on to the next. Keep the momentum going, ensuring that the team remains engaged and focused throughout the estimation session.</p>
